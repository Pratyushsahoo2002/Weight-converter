Hello fellowsðŸ˜Ž,
How's it going? here back with a havascript project: Weight-Converter{pretty simple one}.
ðŸ”´ GitHub link:https://github.com/Pratyushsahoo2002/Weight-converter


ðŸŸ¢FEATURESðŸŸ¢

âœ… Simple gradient UI with Glassmorphism card and inset shadows for depth.

âœ… On every input change a function gets executed which converts weight in kg to weight in pounds lbs.

âœ… It also handles errors such as if someone tries to provide a negative or NaN or zero number it shows a custom error for 2 seconds with setTimeout

âœ… Similarly it shows thank you after a successful weight conversion removes values from the input field and goes back to default.
